<h1>Welcome to my Blog</h1>
<p>I'm an Electrical Engineer developing open-source hacks, building robots, open-source programming, embedded system, control system engineering and blogging, reading, writing, also teaching. I believe that creative engineering is indistinguishable from fine artwork. I’m a very strong believer and promoter of the “learn by doing” motto. Now, I am working as an Assistant Professor at Department of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Vocational College, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia.</p>
